# Lab2: Wall following performance of a mobile autonomus robot

## Abstract 

The main purpose of this lab excerise was to implement wall followin algorithm for an autonomus mobile robot. This kind of movement is based only to sensor fusion.

## Mobile Robot 

The mobile robot that we studied was differential-drive is equipped with:
* Two wheels with diameter equal to 20cm
* Five ultrasound sensors for distance measurement
* One IMU  (Inertial Measurement  Unit) 9 degrees' of freedom for linear- angular velocity/acceleration measurement


## Algorithm Description

The algorithm is simply transitions between three or even better two states

### State 1: Wall Approach (One time, from start position) 

### State 2: Turn to a corner 

### State 3: Wall Following
